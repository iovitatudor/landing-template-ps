              long-term growth. Unlike traditional pre-sales, participants gain special trading privileges for the first
              100 blocks, promoting competitive advantages and protecting against market manipulation. This approach
              supports early project stages, creates a fair market, and includes VIP and Public (Open to All) Presale
              components for a successful token launch and stability.</p>
